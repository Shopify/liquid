---

Creates an array of values by extracting the values of a named property from another object.

In this example, assume the object `site.pages` contains all the metadata for a website. Using `assign` with the `map` filter creates a variable that contains only the values of the `category` properties of everything in the `site.pages` object.

<p class="code-label">Input</p>
```liquid
{%- raw -%}
{% assign all_categories = site.pages | map: "category" %}

{% for item in all_categories %}
- {{ item }}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

<p class="code-label">Output</p>
```text
- business
- celebrities
- lifestyle
- sports
- technology
```
