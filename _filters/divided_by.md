Divides a number by another number.

The result is rounded down to the nearest integer (that is, the [floor]({{ "/filters/floor/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})) if the divisor is an integer.

<p class="code-label">Input</p>
```liquid
{%- raw -%}
{{ 16 | divided_by: 4 }}
{{ 5 | divided_by: 3 }}
{% endraw %}
```

<p class="code-label">Output</p>
```text
{{ 16 | divided_by: 4 }}
{{ 5 | divided_by: 3 }}
```

### Controlling rounding

`divided_by` produces a result of the same type as the divisor â€” that is, if you divide by an integer, the result will be an integer. If you divide by a float (a number with a decimal in it), the result will be a float.

<p class="code-label">Input</p>
```liquid
{%- raw -%}
{{ 20 | divided_by: 7 }}
{{ 20 | divided_by: 7.0 }}
{% endraw %}
```

<p class="code-label">Output</p>
```text
{{ 20 | divided_by: 7 }}
{{ 20 | divided_by: 7.0 }}
```

### Changing variable types

You might want to use a variable as a divisor, in which case you can't simply add `.0` to convert it to a float. In these cases, you can `assign` a version of your variable converted to a float using the `times` filter to [multiply]({{ "/filters/times/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) the variable by `1.0`.

In this example, when we divide by a variable that contains an integer, we get an integer result. When we convert the variable to float and divide by the float instead, we get a float result.

<p class="code-label">Input</p>
```liquid
{%- raw -%}
{% assign my_integer = 7 %} {{ 20 | divided_by: my_integer }}
{% assign my_float = my_integer | times: 1.0 %}
{{ 20 | divided_by: my_float }}
{% endraw %}
```

<p class="code-label">Output</p>
```text
{% assign my_integer = 7 -%}
{{ 20 | divided_by: my_integer }}
{% assign my_float = my_integer | times: 1.0 -%}
{{ 20 | divided_by: my_float }}
```
