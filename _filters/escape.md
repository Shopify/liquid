description: Liquid filter that escapes URL-unsafe characters in a string.
---

Escapes a string by replacing characters with escape sequences (so that the string can be used in a URL, for example). It doesn't change strings that don't have anything to escape.

<p class="code-label">Input</p>
```liquid
{%- raw -%}
{{ "Have you read 'James & the Giant Peach'?" | escape }}
{{ "Tetsuro Takara" | escape }}
{% endraw %}
```

<p class="code-label">Output</p>
```text
{{ "Have you read 'James & the Giant Peach'?" | escape }}
{{ "Tetsuro Takara" | escape }}
```
