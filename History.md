## Before 1.9.0

* Added If with or / and expressions

* [...] Gazillion of detail improvements
* Added strainers as filter hosts for better security [Tobias Luetke]
* Fixed that rails integration would call filter with the wrong "self" [Michael Geary]

* Removed count helper from standard lib. use size [Tobias Luetke]
* Fixed bug with string filter parameters failing to tolerate commas in strings. [Paul Hammond]
* Improved filter parameters. Filter parameters are now context sensitive; Types are resolved according to the rules of the context. Multiple parameters are now separated by the Liquid::ArgumentSeparator: , by default [Paul Hammond]

* Added Liquid::Drop. A base class which you can use for exporting proxy objects to liquid which can acquire more data when used in liquid. [Tobias Luetke]

  class ProductDrop < Liquid::Drop
    def top_sales
       Shop.current.products.find(:all, :order => 'sales', :limit => 10 )
    end
  end
  t = Liquid::Template.parse( ' {% for product in product.top_sales %} {{ product.name }} {% endfor %} '  )
  t.render('product' => ProductDrop.new )
* Added filter parameters support. Example: {{ date | format_date: "%Y" }} [Paul Hammond]
